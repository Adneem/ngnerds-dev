# ü§î Git vs GitHub: What's the Difference?

If you‚Äôre starting out new, it‚Äôs easy to confuse Git with GitHub, especially since GitHub is so widely used.

But they‚Äôre not the same thing. Git is the actual version control software that runs locally on your computer, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration features on top.

The connection between them? GitHub uses Git under the hood, but Git itself works perfectly fine without GitHub (or any internet connection at all).

## üõ†Ô∏è Create a Local Git Repository (Without GitHub)

You don‚Äôt need GitHub to start using Git. In fact, Git works entirely on your local machine ‚Äî no internet required.

### üì• Install Git

I won‚Äôt walk through the installation process here, as there are many excellent guides online. One reliable resource is this tutorial from Atlassian:

üîó [How to Install Git ‚Äì Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

### üß™ Initialize Your First Git Repository

First, confirm that Git is installed on your system:

```bash
git --version
```

Then, follow these steps to create a new local repository:

```bash
mkdir my-first-repo
cd my-first-repo
git init
echo "# Hello Git" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "First commit"
git log
```
‚úÖ What You Just Did:

* Created a new project directory
* Initialized a Git repository inside it
* Added and committed your first file
* Viewed the commit history

You now have a working Git repository, all running locally, with no GitHub involved.

## ü§ù Git Is All You Need to Collaborate

One common misconception is that you need GitHub (or another online service) to collaborate with others. You don‚Äôt.

At its core, Git is a fully capable distributed version control system. With just Git, you can:

- Share repositories directly via file systems, and over a network
- Push and pull changes between developers
- Merge contributions and resolve conflicts

What platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket add is convenience:

- A centralized remote repository
- Web-based collaboration tools like pull requests, issues, and project boards
- Access control and user management
- A UI to visualize branches, commits, and contributors

These services enhance teamwork and visibility, but the foundation is always Git.

> Git enables collaboration, GitHub makes it easier.

## üåê Now Let‚Äôs Use GitHub

You would need a Github account. If you don't have one, please create one at : https://github.com/

### Create a new repository

Once you have a Github account, create a new repository

* Go to github.com/new
* Name it my-first-repo
* Keep it public (for now) and don‚Äôt initialize with README
* Click Create Repository

### Connect Your Local Repo to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-first-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
Now your local Git history is visible on GitHub!
