# Why This Course Starts with Git

Whether you're writing code, building a machine learning model, writing database scripts, creating infrastructure as code, or collaborating on technical documentation, **version control is fundamental**.

It doesn't matter if you're a:
- Frontend developer
- Data scientist
- Cloud engineer
- Embedded systems programmer
- Product manager

If you're in tech, you're managing changes to files. And that means you need version control.

## The Pre-Git Days: A Frustrating Past

Before Git, the industry relied on tools like CVS, Subversion (SVN), and Perforce. While these systems introduced the concept of managing changes over time, they had their own challanges:

- Centralized servers: if the server was down, you couldn’t commit.
- Awkward branching: merging was painful and risky.
- Slow operations: especially for large projects.
- Poor offline capabilities.

I’ve seen developers **avoid branching altogether**, not out of preference, but out of fear, merging diverged branches had never been easy with the version control software that came before git.

Version control wasn’t empowering. It was something to be tolerated.

## The Rise of Git: A Paradigm Shift

Then Git arrived.

It was fast. It was distributed. It embraced branching and merging as first-class features. You could:

- Commit changes offline
- Work on multiple ideas simultaneously
- Merge confidently
- Experiment freely

Suddenly, version control was no longer a bottleneck, it became a superpower. The arrival of Git, with its speed, flexibility, and ease of use, played a pivotal role in enabling modern DevOps practices. In fact, the rise of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) was made possible, in large part, because teams could now collaborate, merge, and deliver code with confidence, thanks to Git. 

Today, Git is:
- The **de facto** standard in software development
- At the heart of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
- A required skill in nearly every job posting in tech

## Why Start Here?

We’re beginning this course and this platform with Git because:

- **Version control is foundational** to working in tech
- **Git is the most powerful and widely adopted tool** in this space
- **Fluency in Git builds confidence** in collaboration, experimentation, and recovery from mistakes

You don’t need to be afraid of breaking things when you have Git. You gain the freedom to create boldly, knowing there’s always a safe way back.

This isn’t just a Git tutorial. It’s the beginning of how you manage your work, your projects, and your collaboration for the rest of your career.

Let’s begin.
